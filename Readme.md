# Professional Computer Vision Toolkit

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x450.png/1e1e1e/FFFFFF?text=Application+Screenshot+Here" alt="Application Screenshot"/>
</p>

A real-time, professional computer vision toolkit built with C++. It leverages OpenCV for powerful image processing and Dear ImGui for a dynamic, interactive user interface. The application is designed with a modular processing pipeline, allowing for the easy extension and side-by-side comparison of new vision algorithms.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Camera Processing:** Captures video from connected cameras and processes it live.
- **Dynamic & Interactive UI:** Built with Dear ImGui for a professional and easy-to-use interface.
- **Side-by-Side View:** Display multiple processing outputs (Original, Grayscale, Canny, etc.) simultaneously for easy comparison.
- **Runtime Parameter Tuning:** Adjust algorithm parameters (e.g., blur kernel size, Canny thresholds) in real-time with sliders and see the effects instantly.
- **Modular Architecture:** The `IProcessor` interface allows new image processing algorithms to be added cleanly and with minimal boilerplate.
- **Cross-Platform:** Built with CMake and Conan for easier compilation on different operating systems.

### Implemented Processors
- Original RGB
- Grayscale
- Gaussian Blur
- Canny Edges
- Contour Detection
- HSV Color Mask

## Technology Stack

- **Core:** C++17
- **Image Processing:** [OpenCV 4](https://opencv.org/)
- **GUI:** [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- **Windowing & OpenGL:** [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) & [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- **Build System:** [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.15+)
- **Dependency Management:** [Conan](https://conan.io/)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your system:
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.15 or higher)
- [Conan](https://conan.io/downloads.html) (version 2.x recommended)

### Installation & Building

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY].git
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY]
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies with Conan:**
    Conan will download and set up all required libraries (OpenCV, ImGui, etc.). This command installs the dependencies declared in the `conanfile.py` and creates the necessary toolchain file for CMake.
    ```sh
    conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing
    ```

3.  **Configure and Build with CMake:**
    These commands will configure the project using the Conan-generated toolchain and then compile the application.

    ```sh
    # Navigate into the build directory where Conan placed its files
    cd build

    # Configure the project with CMake
    # This tells CMake where to find the libraries managed by Conan
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake

    # Build the project using parallel jobs for speed
    cmake --build . --parallel
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the build is complete, you can run the application in two ways:

1.  **Using the `run` target (if available in your CMake):**
    ```sh
    # Still inside the 'build' directory
    cmake --build . --target run
    ```

2.  **Running the executable directly:**
    The final executable will be located in the `build/bin` directory.
    ```sh
    # Still inside the 'build' directory
    ./bin/realsense
    ```

---

## How to Use the Application

- **Camera Selection:** Use the radio buttons in the "Controls" panel to switch between available camera sources.
- **Enable/Disable Feeds:** Use the checkboxes to toggle the visibility of each processing feed.
- **Adjust Parameters:** Expand the collapsing headers (e.g., "Blur", "Canny") to access sliders and controls for tuning the algorithms in real-time.

## Project Structure

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add a new image processing feature, the typical workflow is:

1.  Create a new class that inherits from `IProcessor` in `src/processing/include/cvt/processing/Processors.h`.
2.  Implement the `process()` method with your OpenCV logic.
3.  Add any required UI controls (sliders, etc.) to `main.cpp`.
4.  Instantiate your new processor in the `feeds` vector in `main.cpp`.
5.  Submit a pull request with your changes.
